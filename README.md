# Maximum-Likelihood

In this project, maximum likelihood estimate is used to find the parameters of a linear model fitted on our data. 
Here, the poisson distribution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution is used as a discrete probability distribution often used to describe count-based data, like how many snowflakes fall in a day.
